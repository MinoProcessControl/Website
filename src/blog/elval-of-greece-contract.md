The first phase of the project has now been completed with the installation of a new MINO AVANTI technological control system, designed and built by MINO Process Control in the UK. Additionally, a new high resolution shape meter roll, roll coolant spray bars, X ray thickness gauges and new laser strip speed measurement devices were also installed. The spray bar system includes the MINO 'hot edge spray' system (H.E.S) for greater thermal control of the strip edge during high speed rolling. The H.E.S includes the latest in line MINO hot coolant delivery system for heating the rolling oil to dedicated spray nozzles.

The new 'Avanti' system includes the latest software control applications for AGC including Mass Flow and Feed Forward thickness control, complemented by the MINO advanced flatness control.

Also included in the improvements to the exit side of the rolling mill is a strip surface dryness system to remove residue rolling oil from the sheet surface before coiling. This equipment was designed and built in MINO's workshop based at its HQ in Alessandria, Italy.

Other improvements to the rolling mill will follow in phase two of the project.

This project is part of a strategic investment for Elval to improve one of its key rolling mill assets producing high added value sheet products.

This award to MINO follows on from the project under construction at Elval's sister plant in Bridgnorth, UK where MINO are contracted to make a total rebuild of a cold rolling mill for the Bridgnorth plant.
